# NYC Citi Bike-Sharing Analysis
Module 14 
## Objective 
For this Challenge we are analyzing NYC bike sharing program to create compelling visualizations of the data for investors considering a similar program in Des Moines. 

## Analysis
We are using Pandas first to transform the data, Tableau to create visualizations, and storyboards within Tableau to present to the investors. 

In August 2019 over 2.3 million bikes were used in the NYC Citi Bike sharing program. Of those 2.3 million rides, 1.9 were used by subscribers that regular rent the bikes. The following analysis breaks down these users and visualizes their age, gender, trip locations, duractions, and weekdays. The program appears to be popular among locals using the bikes to get to and from work, or around, while avoiding rush hour car traffic. I've concluded this assumption from the heatmaps, and time of rentals.
